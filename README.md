# Arduino Simple Calculator
This project implements a basic calculator using Arduino. It includes the code for the Arduino board and a simulation designed in Proteus.

# Overview
This repository contains the code written in Arduino IDE for a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It also includes a Proteus simulation for visualizing the circuit and functionality of the calculator.

# Features
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
Arduino code written in C/C++ for performing calculations.
Proteus simulation demonstrating the functionality of the calculator.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the code and simulation, you'll need:

Arduino IDE installed on your system.
Proteus software for simulating the circuit.
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:
